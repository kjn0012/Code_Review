# Biol7180 Code Review
### Kira Noordwijk

## Project Proposal
The purpose of this study is to perform Bayesian deconvolution methods on bulk RNA sequencing data from equine sarcoid tumor samples.

###Aim
Adapt exisitng code for the application of Bayesian modelling for RNA sequencing in oncology to bulk RNA sequencing data in equine sarcoid tumors (and hopefully sn-RNA-seq if we get it to work asap)

## Data
The data was collect retrospectively from the hospital electronic database and electronic surgical records. Additional data was collect from published material to increase data volume.
